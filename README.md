## Personal Word

This is a one week project, focusing on simple features : filters on home page, comments, like on single image page, uploading picture, and hashtags.
I really enjoyed this project, this was the first time I got into the module concept, having a deep understanding of a website structure.



**I like how easy it is to make a filter features with Angular JS.**

**You can upload images. I used an **Amazon S3** bucket to store all the images online.**

**I made the MVP for a responsive design, I still need to improve it.**
